# JavaScript Game Developer coding test

## Task
Make a high-low card game using React/Redux and Canvas.  
You can quickly check the current state [here](https://aleksej10.github.io/canvas/).  


## How to run
* Create new react project with 
  ```
  npx create-react-app app-name
  ```
* cd into newly created directory
  ```
  cd app-name
  ```
* Switch contents of `src` folder with one from this repo
* Finally, start the app with 
  ```
  npm start
  ```

## Current state
![demo](https://github.com/Aleksej10/canvas/blob/master/demo.gif)  
Game is **almost** *fully functional.  
It is written in React/Redux using css for UI elements.  

*fully:
  - Parts of the game logic are awaiting clearance (namely `new game` and `collect` buttons).
  - UI is still to be implemented using Canvas.


## TODO
* Organize code into separate folders.
