# JavaScript Game Developer coding test

## Task
Make a high-low card game using React/Redux and Canvas.  
You can quickly check the current state [here](https://aleksej10.github.io/canvas/).  


## How to run
* Create new react project with 
  ```
  npx create-react-app app-name
  ```
* cd into newly created directory
  ```
  cd app-name
  ```
* Switch contents of `src` folder with one from this repo
* Finally, start the app with 
  ```
  npm start
  ```

## Current status
Game is currently implemented using React only.   
Some functionality (new game/reset money/indicate each turn) is yet to be implemented.  

## TODO
* Render UI elements using canvas instead of div elements.
* Port to Redux.
